Description:
Table 5.1   Dimensions of the Weibel A lung geometry (Weibel 1963) scaled to a 3 l lung volume, and using a volume of 10-5 ml per alveoli, is compared to the symmetric lung geometry used by Finlay et al. (2000). The thick lines in the table indicate the border between the alveolar and tracheo-bronchial regions in the models. The mouth-throat volume has not been included in the cumulative volume.
